# The Solidity to IELE Compiler

This is the Solidity to IELE compiler, a fork of the [Solidity compiler](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) targeting [IELE](https://github.com/runtimeverification/iele-semantics) instead of the EVM. 

## Useful links
To get started you can find an introduction to the language in the [Solidity documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.org). In the documentation, you can find [code examples](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html) as well as [a reference](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solidity-in-depth.html) of the syntax and details on how to write smart contracts.

You can start using [Solidity in your browser](http://remix.ethereum.org) with no need to download or compile anything.

The changelog for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/Changelog.md).

Solidity is still under development. So please do not hesitate and open an [issue in GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues) if you encounter anything strange.

## Building
The standard [Solidity documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#building-from-source) contains build instructions relevant for both EVM and IELE backends. 
For a summary, and for any IELE-specific information which may be available in future, also see [README-IELE-INSTALL](README-IELE-INSTALL.md)
